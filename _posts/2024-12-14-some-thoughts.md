Great video. Among other things, I finally learned about world reserve currencies and the history of the US dollar. It's interesting how the US dollar changed from being backed by gold to being backed by debt. The US dollar defaulted on its gold standard twice, in 1933 under Roosevelt and in 1971 under Nixon.  
After World War II, the world powers met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, and decided to peg their currencies to the US dollar. The US dollar was then backed by gold, and the US promised to convert any US dollar to gold at a rate of $35 per ounce. 
It is no coincidence that the US dollar is the world's reserve currency. The world powers met and agreed upon a new world order.

Now, with shifting global power dynamics it raises questions:
Should we start learning chinese?
How long will the dollar remain dominant?
Should we start paying attention to the Chinese yuan?

What do you think? Comment your thoughts below. Will Trump save us? Will the dollar hold, or is it time to start learning Chinese?
