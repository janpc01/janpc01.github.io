Great video. Among other things, I finally learned about world reserve currencies and the history of the US dollar. It's interesting how the US dollar changed from being backed by gold to being backed by debt. The US dollar defaulted on its gold standard twice, in 1933 under Roosevelt and in 1971 under Nixon.  

It was interesting to learn about how in 1944, near the end of World War II, the world powers met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, and decided upon the new world order. "The Bretton Woods agreement and system created a collective international currency exchange regime that lasted from the mid-1940s to the early 1970s. The Bretton Woods system required a currency peg to the U.S. dollar which was in turn pegged to the price of gold."

It is no coincidence that the US dollar is the world's reserve currency. It seems to be a direct outcome of the World Wars. 

Now, with shifting global power dynamics it raises questions:
How long will the dollar remain dominant?
Should we start paying attention to the Chinese yuan?

What do you think? Comment your thoughts below. Will Trump save us? Will the dollar hold, or is it time to start learning Chinese?
